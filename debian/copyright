 This is a prologue that allows to run a perl script as an executable
 on systems that are compliant to a POSIX version before POSIX:2017.
 On such systems, the usual invocation of an executable through execlp()
 or execvp() fails with ENOEXEC if it is a script that does not start
 with a #! line.  The script interpreter mentioned in the #! line has
 to be /bin/sh, because on GuixSD systems that is the only program that
 has a fixed file name.  The second line is essential for perl and is
 also useful for editing this file in Emacs.  The next two lines below
 are valid code in both sh and perl.  When executed by sh, they re-execute
 the script through the perl program found in $PATH.  The '-x' option
 is essential as well; without it, perl would re-execute the script
 through /bin/sh.  When executed by perl, the next two lines are a no-op.

 In this testcase, and in the chunk of code that makes use
 of $bindir in ltmain.in, we would very much have liked to
 automatically decide which systems require dynamically-loaded
 libraries to be installed to a directory in $PATH according
 to the libtool properties that tell us that "the system provides
 no way to hard-code library paths into executables, and also

 We used to maintain separate (but extremely similiar!) README and
 README.alpha files, and had 'make dist' include the right one in a
 distribution based on the contests of '$(VERSION)'.
 .
 Now, we have 'make dist' call this script to tweak the first paragraph
 of README in situ, to be more suitable for an alpha quality release.

 It should be possible to use a nontrivial relative path to the output
 file name when creating libraries and programs.  The deplibs of these
 might have relative paths as well.  When executing uninstalled programs,
 the paths relative to $PWD at build time needs to be translated to a
 path valid at execution time.

 This script is derived from GIT-VERSION-GEN from GIT: https://git-scm.com/.
 It may be run two ways:
 - from a git repository in which the "git describe" command below
 produces useful output (thus requiring at least one signed tag)
 - from a non-git-repo directory containing a .tarball-version file, which
 presumes this script is invoked like "./git-version-gen .tarball-version".
 .
 In order to use intra-version strings in your project, you will need two
 separate generated version string files:
 .
 .tarball-version - present only in a distribution tarball, and not in
 a checked-out repository.  Created with contents that were learned at
 the last time autoconf was run, and used by git-version-gen.  Must not
 be present in either $(srcdir) or $(builddir) for git-version-gen to
 give accurate answers during normal development with a checked out tree,
 but must be present in a tarball when there is no version control system.
 Therefore, it cannot be used in any dependencies.  GNUmakefile has
 hooks to force a reconfigure at distribution time to get the value
 correct, without penalizing normal development with extra reconfigures.
 .
 .version - present in a checked-out repository and in a distribution
 tarball.  Usable in dependencies, particularly for files that don't
 want to depend on config.h but do want to track version changes.
 Delete this file prior to any autoconf run where you want to rebuild
 files to pick up a version string change; and leave it stale to
 minimize rebuild time after unrelated changes to configure sources.
 .
 As with any generated file in a VC'd directory, you should add
 /.version to .gitignore, so that you don't accidentally commit it.
 .tarball-version is never generated in a VC'd directory, so needn't
 be listed there.
 .
 Use the following line in your configure.ac, so that $(VERSION) will
 automatically be up-to-date each time configure is run (and note that
 since configure.ac no longer includes a version string, Makefile rules
 should not depend on configure.ac for version updates).

License:   __HEADER___
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 .
 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 .
 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 .
 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 introduced by others.
 .
 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 .
 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
 libraries into non-free programs.
 .
 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 the library.
 .
 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
 does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
 special circumstances.
 .
 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
 a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
 allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
 .
 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
 system.
 .
 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
 users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
 that program using a modified version of the Library.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
 be combined with the library in order to run.
 .
 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 .
 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 .
 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 and installation of the library.
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
 a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 .
 b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
 c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 .
 d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.
 .
 (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 these notices.
 .
 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 .
 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.
 .
 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange.
 .
 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 .
 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 .
 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 .
 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 .
 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 .
 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.
 .
 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 of these things:
 .
 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)
 .
 b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
 .
 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.
 .
 d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.
 .
 e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 .
 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
 .
 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.
 .
 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 .
 a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.
 .
 b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 .
 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.
 .
 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 this License.
 .
 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 written in the body of this License.
 .
 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 and reuse of software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 .
 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 ordinary General Public License).
 .
 To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
 <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
 This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
 modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
 License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
 version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
 .
 This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
 Lesser General Public License for more details.
 .
 You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
 License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
 Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 .
 Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

                        Version 2, June 1991
 .
  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
                             Preamble
 .
   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.
 .
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 .
   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 .
   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
 rights.
 .
   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 distribute and/or modify the software.
 .
   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 authors' reputations.
 .
   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
 patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 .
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 .
                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
 refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 .
   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 along with the Program.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 .
   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.
 .
     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Program.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 .
     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
     customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
     received the program in object code or executable form with such
     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 .
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
 special exception, the source code distributed need not include
 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
 itself accompanies the executable.
 .
 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 parties remain in full compliance.
 .
   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Program or works based on it.
 .
   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
 this License.
 .
   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 .
   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
 later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
 Foundation.
 .
   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 .
                             NO WARRANTY
 .
   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
 .
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
 .
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
 when it starts in an interactive mode:
 .
     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 .
 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
 be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 .
   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
 .
   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
   Ty Coon, President of Vice
 .
 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
 consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
 library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
 Public License instead of this License.
